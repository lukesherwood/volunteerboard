## Blog post

Hey guys, I'm going to quickly show you through my volunteer job board app. 

It's a meeting place for organisations and willing volunteers.

I created it using Ruby on Rails as part of the Flatiron Software development course. 

And to be honest, this is the first app I've created that has come together and looks and feels like a real website.

I'll quickly show you through the basics so you can get a feel for it

The welcome page diverts users to either volunteers or organisation owners. 

Lets start by creating a organisation

World Health Organisation
Geneva, Switzerland
The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. The WHO Constitution, which establishes the agency's governing structure and principles, states its main objective as "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health"
www.who.int
WHO Headquarters in Geneva
Avenue Appia 20
1211 Geneva
Telephone: +41-22-7912111

and here is our new organisation

we can now create a new event 

Corona-virus Press Conference
NY, NY

Watch the @WHO press conference for the latest updates on the global #COVID19 response 
The Access to COVID-19 Accelerator is uniting efforts on many fronts to ensure we have safe, effective and affordable therapeutics and vaccines in the shortest time possible.
These tools provide additional hope of overcoming COVID-19, but they will not end the pandemic if we cannot ensure equitable access to them.
In these extraordinary circumstances, we need to unleash the full power of science, to deliver innovations that are scalable, usable, and benefit everyone, everywhere, at the same time.

Sign-language translator
 Palo santo butcher plaid, godard williamsburg ramps bespoke church-key artisan small batch deep v hammock. Kombucha raw denim truffaut offal.


Now if we go back and imagine we are a good person with some extra time on our hands 
lets see if we can find a volunteering job to try help out.
We are now seeing all available jobs we can scroll down until something sounds good, 
oh look a sign-language translator that sounds like me
we can then take this job
and we can assume that the organisation owner will now get in touch with us

And there we have it, thanks for watching guys. Check the description for a link to the github repo. Cheers.
